NO PULL REQUESTS!!!
The Skyscraper project is not currently looking for collaborators and for that reason pull requests are respectfully rejected.
In the rare case where a pull request will be considered it will previously have been discussed and coordinated at the RetroPie forums here:
https://retropie.org.uk/forum/topic/11826/versatile-c-game-scraper-skyscraper
Please go there and describe your suggested contribution to the last detail. The code itself is rarely the useful part of a pull request. It is the documentation showing that what you are suggesting to implement is valid, sane and useful to the majority of people using Skyscraper.
